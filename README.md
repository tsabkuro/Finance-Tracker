## Helping you be financially responsible

The application *FinanceTracker* will let the user will be able to record their purchases as well as sort them into
different categories. The app will then show the user exactly where their money is going, and they will be able to
decide where to cut costs. Because people will be able to keep track of where all of their money is going, this app will
help them be more financially responsible. This application is able to be used by anyone who has interest in monitoring
their finances. This project is interesting to me because I think that being responsible financially is extremely
important. Managing your money is a great way to know where to cut costs and achieve financial freedom in the future.
